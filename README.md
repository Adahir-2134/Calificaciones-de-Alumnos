Program made by me using different classes to calculate the average of a student depending on their grades, as well as being able to save the students in a list so that they can later consult all their grades and their general average, without limit of students. Next updates soon

• Login
• Attendance
• partials
• Enrollments
• Bachelor's degrees
• Quarters

With the objective of being able to make a more complete project that can later be used as a system for teachers, as a list for partials.
